Thoughts:

From the starting point we need to essentially choose a random direction and do a depth traveral
as far as we can. Every room that we enter will mean we need to update the '?' direction from the
previous room as well as it's own.

Any direction that cannot be travered we can mark accordingly.

We could use a BFT to handle some initial issues but I think potentially the whole thing could be done
with just DFT.

We will need to keep track of the previous direction, cardinal value, current room ID etc.
